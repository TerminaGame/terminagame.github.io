This update provides general improvements to Termina and is recommended for all users.

#### Battle with Termina
The final battle with Termina has been rewritten. A weapon will and health hotfix will always spawn in the room and Termina's health is much higher and is unlikely to be dead in one hit. In addition to this, if the player defeats Termina, when the player leaves the room, Termina will go through a post-battle monologue.

#### Other Notes
* Help command now displays Termina help page (to be published).
* Developer commands have been fixed.
