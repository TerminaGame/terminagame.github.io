This update provides general improvements to Termina and is recommended for all users.

* Arguments can now be passed before running the game:
    * `--endless` - Runs the game in Endless Mode. This ignores player version and skips over the Termina battle.
    * `--reset` - Resets the player's settings, excluding the name, to a band-new state.
    * `--version` - Reports the full version of the game.
    * `--help` - Displays a list of all possible arguments.
