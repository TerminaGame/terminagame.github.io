This is the first stable release of the Termina for macOS game. Termina for macOS is the official GUI version of the Termina game, built in Swift and SpriteKit.

- **Endless rooms. Never-ending fun.** Termina for macOS holds its roots with the original Termina game while using SpriteKit to bring it to life. Enter new rooms, collect items, catch errors, and heal with a new graphical look.
- **Take your pick.** Termina for macOS offers the standard game experience and a brand-new Harcdore mode. Can you survive with just one life? Create a new player or import your existing one to get in on the action.
- **Start fresh.** Want to start over or create a new player? It's easy to reset or delete your player data in Termina for macOS.
- **More entertaining.** Termina for macOS takes advantage of SpriteKit to give you a new experience, from platforming to new areas to tiles affected by gravity. Rooms feel more lively and entertaining to play in with 30 new designs and new backgrounds.
- **Made just for you.** Termina's preferences pane gives you more control over how you want to enjoy Termina. Change your notification settings, hide elements of the heads-up display, or turn on benchmarking features such as node count and FPS.
