This update provides general improvements to Termina and is recommended for all users.

* Strings have been updated to reflect computer/programming terms instead of dungeon terms.
* Hardcore Mode has been introduced as a binary argument. The player, when dying, will lose their data in this one-time run.
* Item uses are now more accurate and don't "lose" more uses when leaving rooms or attacking than intended.
* Backend code has been cleaned up and some parts of the code reside in their objects instead of the command interpreter.
* New alternative commands have been added:
    - `ls` - combines `whereami` and `whoami` together
    - `apply-hotfix` - same as `heal`
    - `patch` - same as `xp`
    - `exit --force` - quit the game without any prompts. Log is printed.
* The logger now will try saving files with hashes at the end of the name if it detects both the `termlog.bak.txt` and `termlog.txt` files.
