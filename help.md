## Getting Started with Termina
Termina is a single-user dungeon game written in Swift. The objective of the game is to level the player up by catching errors, healing, and incrementing experience and eventually defeat Termina, your captor.

### Installing Termina
Termina can be played by two means: the command-line (base) or the graphical user interface (varies). Achieving the same actions listed in this article may be different depending on what variant you are playing.

To get Termina and install it, get the release from the [Releases]({{ site.bseurl }}/releases.html) page and follow the instructions provided. If you are using the GUI variant, you may want to search your operating system's app store or software center for the game.

### Game Modes
There are three game modes available for Termina:
* _Regular Mode_ is the regular game with the boss battle with Termina and the story.
* _Endless Mode_ removes the story aspect and lets players keep playing infinitely.
* _Hardcore Mode_ is a single run designed for maximum difficulty.

Unless noted otherwise, the default is usually _Regular Mode_.
